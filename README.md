# Xenon Game

Back in my A-levels we had a project where we should develop a game based on the old shooter Xenon.
The intention and scale of the task was more about creating a Rectangle that could move, shoot other rectangles and would get damage when hit by also other rectangles.
Maybe it should also not be able to move outside the "map". In the best case.ðŸ˜„
Of course did I took that a bit far and replaced rectangles with graphics, added ammunition, ship upgrades, high scores and even boss levels.
The theme was heavily inspired by the great old Star Trek series TOS, TNG, DS9 and Voyager.ðŸ––

## Disclaimer

When you review the code and probably can't believe how "good" it's structure and quality is, please remember that I wrote this code long ago as one of my first ever projects.
For the authenticity I don't wanted to change anything. Even if that means the code isn't perfect, it's at least authentic. 
And as far as I remember: it was bug-free.ðŸ˜Ž
